# Heart Disease Prediction Analysis

## Overview
This project aims to explore and analyze data related to heart disease prediction. The Jupyter notebook in this repository provides an in-depth exploratory analysis of patient data, including age, cholesterol levels, and other vital health indicators. It also includes preprocessing steps and the application of machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of heart disease.

## Data
The dataset used in this project includes various parameters such as:
- Age
- Sex
- Chest Pain Type
- Resting ECG results
- Exercise Angina
- ST Slope
- Fasting Blood Sugar
- Presence of Heart Disease

## Analysis Highlights
- Exploration of both numerical and categorical data.
- Identification of key patterns and correlations.
- Data preprocessing, including handling missing values and data normalization.
- Application of KNeighborsRegressor, KNearestNeighbors for predictive modeling.

## Usage
To run the notebook, ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed, along with Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn.

## DataSet
The dataset is available for download at [Heart Failure Prediction Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction). You will need to sign up for a Kaggle account if you do not already have one.
